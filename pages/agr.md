# The US Department of Agriculture 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AminPIC/playgroundsite/master/assets/img/USDA_logo.png)
## Overview

Founded by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862, when more than half of the Nation's population lived and worked on farms, USDA's role has evolved with the economy.  Today, the country looks to rural America to not only provide food and fiber, but also for crucial emerging economic opportunities in renewable energy, broadband and recreation.  People in rural areas operate in a technologically advanced, rapidly diversifying, and highly competitive business environment driven by increasingly sophisticated consumers.  To assist the country in addressing today's challenges, USDA will: Assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, re-populating, and economically thriving; Ensure our national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate change, while enhancing our water resources; Help America promote sustainable agricultural production and biotechnology exports as America works to increase food security; Ensure that all of America's children have access to safe, nutritious, and balanced meals.

## Mission

The Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management.
