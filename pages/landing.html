<h2>Agency Priority Goals</h2>

<p class="usa-font-lead">
  Twenty-four major Federal agencies also identify a limited number of two-year
  Agency Priority Goals aligned with their strategic goals and objectives. Agency
  Priority Goals target areas where agency leaders want to achieve near-term 
  performance acceleration through focused senior leadership attention.

<h2>Cross Agency Priority Goals</h2>

<p class="usa-font-lead">
  Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) 
  Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas 
  where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming 
  organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.
