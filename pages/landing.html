<h2>Cross Agency Priority Goals</h2>

<p class="usa-font-lead">
  Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) 
  Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas 
  where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming 
  organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.
